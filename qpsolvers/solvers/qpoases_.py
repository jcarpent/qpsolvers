Solver interface for `qpOASES <https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES>`__.

qpOASES is an open-source C++ implementation of the online active set strategy,
which was inspired by observations from the field of parametric quadratic
programming. It has theoretical features that make it suitable to model
predictive control. Further numerical modifications have made qpOASES a
reliable QP solver, even when tackling semi-definite, ill-posed or degenerated
QP problems. If you are using qpOASES in some academic work, consider citing
the corresponding paper [Ferreau2014]_.

See the :ref:`installation page <qpoases-install>` for additional instructions
on installing this solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.
    max_wsr :
        Maximum number of Working-Set Recalculations given to qpOASES.
    time_limit :
        Set a run time limit in seconds.
    termination_tolerance :
        Relative termination tolerance to stop homotopy. See `qpOASES User's
        Manual <https://www.coin-or.org/qpOASES/doc/3.1/manual.pdf>`_.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    This function relies on some updates from the standard distribution of
    qpOASES. See the `installation instructions
    <https://scaron.info/doc/qpsolvers/installation.html#qpoases>`_ for
    details.

    Empty bounds (`lb`, `ub`, `lbA` or `ubA`) are allowed. This is possible in
    the C++ API but not by the Python API of qpOASES (as of version 3.2.0). If
    using them, be sure to update the Cython file (`qpoases.pyx`) in your
    distribution of qpOASES to convert ``None`` to the null pointer.
